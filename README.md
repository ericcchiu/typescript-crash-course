# typescript-crash-course
A learning repo for typescript

## What's TypeScript?
  * An open-sourced, syntatic superset of JavaScript, developed by MS. 
  * Compiles to readable JavaScript. 
  * Comes with three parts: Language, Language Server, and Compiler. 
  * Works well with Babel 7 
## Rationale behind types
  * Encode constraints and assumptions, such as input sanitation
  * Catch common mistaktes (i.e. incomplete refactors) 
  * Move some runtime errors to compile time (earlier feedbacks, as opposed to learning of mistakes at runtime)
  * Provide consumers (including you) with a great DX (design experience)
